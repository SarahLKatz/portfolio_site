    <div>
      <p><span style={{fontSize: "2em"}}>Hi, I'm Sarah.</span> After graduating from college with a degree in Biology, I spent two years studying physical therapy before realizing that it was not the right field for me. After working in an office for a few years, I decided to pursue a career as a graphic designer. While working as a graphic designer, I realized that I wanted to add web design to my portfolio, so I took a class in Front End Web Development, which is where I fell in love with JavaScript. After finishing that course, I was encouraged to apply to a coding bootcamp. I was accepted to the Web Development Fellowship at Fullstack Academy of Code, a partnership between Fullstack and the NYC Tech Talent Pipleline, where I learned Node, Express, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, React, Redux, and many other technologies and libraries. I graduated from Fullstack in December 2017 and I am excited to begin my career as a software engineer.
